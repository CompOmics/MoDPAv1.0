# MoDPA: Modification-Dependent Protein Associations

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are key regulators of protein function and cellular processes; however, the overall principles of PTM co-regulation and crosstalk remain to be fully understood. 

To overcome the extreme sparsity and heterogeneity of PTM calls across experiments, MoDPA utilizes a variational autoencoder (VAE) to embed per-site detection profiles into a low-dimensional latent space that preserves covariation while denoising missing data. A PTM association network is constructed by correlating latent representations across experiments.

### Reproducing the results

To reproduce our publication's results, you will need :

1. A peptidoform identifications (IDs) file
2. A peptidoform counts file
3. A fasta file to map peptidoforms to proteins

(available at ...?)

#### Preprocessing & PTMs quantification

To speed up the mapping process, a "peptide dictionary" file can be provided, which contains all human tryptic peptides already mapped to proteins. This can be generated by running `1-quant-pipeline-MoDPA_v2/0_preproc_peptide_dict.py`.

The remaining scripts inside the `1-quant-pipeline-MoDPA_v2` parse the peptidoform IDs and counts files to generate absolute counts for each peptidoforms (A). These absolute counts are then used to compute relative PTMs counts (B). 

Example:<br>
`python .\A_Pipeline_Sept2025.py ./v0113-partial/20250217_Peptidoforms_IDs_v0113.csv.gz .\v0113-partial\20251003_Peptidoforms_counts_v0113.csv.gz .\peptide_dict_new.csv.gz .\Human_2023_01_isoforms.fasta.gz`<br>
`python .\B_relative_PTMs.py . 2025-12-19`

###### Prepare VAE training data

Filter the results with `1-quant-pipeline-MoDPA_v2\C_prefilter-relative-PTMs.py` and extract PTM-by-experiment matrices (1 per PTM of interest) using `1-quant-pipeline-MoDPA_v2\D_Get-MoDPA-matrices.py`.<br>
Provide the list of PTMs of interest as a .csv file with the following columns:

|AA|unimod_id|ptm_name|
|----|----|----|
|C|4|Carbamidomethyl|
|M|35|Oxidation|

Combine the PTMs of interest into one dataset with `1-quant-pipeline-MoDPA_v2\E_combine-MoDPA-matrices.py`.

#### Train VAE

Multiple models can be trained at the same time with `2-VAE-code/New-VAE-gridsearch.py`. The hyperparameters of the models can be specified either within the code file OR in a separate .txt file (if hard-coded, they will be saved in a .txt, in case you need to re-run).

After training, run `2-VAE-code/New-VAE-validation.py` to get an overview of trained models and select the best one. The `Latent-space` of the model will serve as input to Step 3, PTM correlations calculation.

***Using a GPU is recommended for training the VAEs.***

#### Calculate correlations between PTMs

Use `3-calculate-correlations/get-signdistance-multiproc-2.py` to calculate signed distances correlations between PTMs in the latent space. To make it feasible to process large datasets (10000+ PTMs), the data is analyzed in chunks. Use `3-calculate-correlations/combine-signdistance-results.py` to combine the partial results into one file and perform multiple testing correction.

#### Pulsed SILAC data analysis

Pulsed SILAC is a variation of SILAC where labeled amino acids are added to the growth medium for a short period to assess de novo protein production. Over time, light-labeled proteins decrease due to turnover, while heavy-labeled proteins increase.<br>
This experimental setup thus provides a simple model in which unlabelled Arginines (R0) and Lysines (K0) will follow similar trends, while their heavy-labeled counterparts (R10, K8) which will exhibit the opposite trend. Other modifications, like Methionine oxidations, are not expected to correlate with light or heavy labels. Validation used rule-based edge labeling: 
1. Positive associations between two heavy or two light residues are valid
2. Negative associations between one heavy and one light residue are valid
3. All other associations are invalid.
